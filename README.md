## What is data structures?
- Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.


## Types of Data Structure
Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:
- Linear data structure ex. Static [Array], Dynamic[linkedlist, stack, Queue].
- Non-linear data structure ex. Tree { Binary Tree,
Binary Search Tree,
AVL Tree,
B-Tree,
B+ Tree,
Red-Black Tree }, Graph.

## Linear data structures
- In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.
- However, when the complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.


## Non linear data structures
Elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence. Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.

## Why Data Structure?
Knowledge about data structures help you understand the working of each data structure. And, based on that you can select the right data structures for your project.



## What is an Algorithms?
An algorithm is defined as a set of rules or a step-by-step procedure that are to be executed in a specific order to get the desired output.

## Type of algorithms:
<b> [Here](https://www.codingninjas.com/blog/2020/06/04/types-of-algorithms-and-its-uses/) </b> is a list of the types of Algorithms to begin with:

- Brute Force algorithm
- Greedy algorithm
- Recursive algorithm
- Backtracking algorithm
- Divide & Conquer algorithm
- Dynamic programming algorithm
- Randomised algorithm

## What is recursion?
- Recursion is a process in which the function calls itself indirectly or directly in order to solve the problem. The function that performs the process of recursion is called a recursive function. There are certain problems that can be solved pretty easily with the help of a recursive algorithm.


## What are the properties that a recursive function must have?
- A recursive function has the capability to continue as an infinite loop. There are two properties that have to be defined for any recursive function to prevent it from going into an infinite loop. They are:

    1. Base criteria – There has to be one predefined base condition. Whenever this base criterion is fulfilled, the function will stop calling itself.
    2. Progressive approach – The recursive calls should consist of a progressive approach. Whenever a recursive call is made to the function, it should be reaching near the base condition.
