# Array

- An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. 

- Types of arrays : 
One dimensional array (1-D arrays)
Multidimensional array


- Advantages of using arrays: 

    - Arrays allow random access to elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster.
    - Arrays have better cache locality which makes a pretty big difference in performance.
    - Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name.

- Disadvantages of using arrays: 
    - You can’t change the size i.e. once you have declared the array you can’t change its size because of static memory allocation. 
    - Here Insertion(s) and deletion(s) are difficult as the elements are stored in consecutive memory locations and the shifting operation is costly too.


- Applications on Array

    - Array stores data elements of the same data type.
    - Arrays are used when the size of the data set is known.
    - Used in solving matrix problems.
    - Applied as a lookup table in computer.
    - Databases records are also implemented by the array.
    - Helps in implementing sorting algorithm.
    - The different variables of the same type can be saved under one name.
    - Arrays can be used for CPU scheduling.
    - Used to Implement other data structures like Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hash tables, etc.
